# diabetes_prediction
This project implements a diabetes prediction model using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The SVM algorithm is trained on a dataset containing relevant health-related features to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes. Users can clone the repository, run the SVM model, and evaluate its performance.
